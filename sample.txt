Arithmetic coding is superior in most respects to the
better-known Huffman [lo] method. It represents information at least as compactly-sometimes considerably more so. Its performance is optimal without
the need for blocking of input data. It encourages a
clear separation between the model for representing
data and the encoding of information with respect to
that model. It accommodates adaptive models easily
and is computationally efficient. Yet many authors
and practitioners seem unaware of the technique.
Indeed there is a widespread belief that Huffman
coding cannot be improved upon.We aim to rectify this situation by presenting an
accessible implementation of arithmetic coding and
by detailing its performance characteristics. We start
by briefly reviewing basic concepts of data compression and introducing the model-based approach that
underlies most modern techniques. We then outline
the idea of arithmetic coding using a simple example, before presenting programs for both encoding
and decoding. In these programs the model occupies
a separate module so that different models can easily
be used. Next we discuss the construction of fixed
and adaptive models and detail the compression
efficiency ahgfgfexecution time of the programs,
including the effect of different arithmetic word
lengths on compression efficiency. Finally, we outline a few applications where arithmetic coding is
appropriate.
